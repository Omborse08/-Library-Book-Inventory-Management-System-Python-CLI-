# ðŸ“š Library Book Inventory Management System (Python CLI)
This is a simple command-line Python project for managing a library's book inventory. It uses core Python concepts like dictionaries, sets, loops, conditionals, and user input handling.


## ðŸš€ Features
1. Add new books with title, author, genre, quantity, and tags
2. Display all books in a clean formatted view
3. Update quantity (increase/decrease)
4. Search books by title or author (partial match allowed)
5. Uses dictionaries for book data and sets for tags
6. Includes input validation and case-insensitive search


## ðŸ§ Concepts Used
- `dict` and its methods: `get()`, `update()`, etc.
- `set` and its methods: `add()`, `update()`, `union()`, etc.
- `if-else`, `while`, `for` loops
- `f-strings`, `split()`, `join()`, `lower()`
- Modular design using options/menu system


## ðŸ™ŒContribution
Feel free to fork the repo and add new features like:
Genre-wise filtering
Sorting by quantity or title
Exporting inventory to CSV


## ðŸ˜„ Fun Fact
This project has read more books than most humans, but still can't get a library card. ðŸ“–ðŸ¤“
